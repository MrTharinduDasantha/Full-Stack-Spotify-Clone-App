# Full Stack Spotify Clone Website

In this project, I will make a Full-stack spotify clone website using React JS, Node JS, Express JS, and MongoDB. 

In this spotify clone website project we will create the frontend website, Admin Panel and Backend server.

We will create admin panel where we can upload the songs, images and song album. We will also learn how to store images and audio files on cloudinary storage.
